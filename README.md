This enclosure is for the famous SLG3000 scanline generator from Arcadeforge
It has M3 printed threaded screw inserts. Thus a good printer is needed plus fine resolution noozle. Screw M4 length 20mm are needed. 

Take M3 Screws with length 20mm. Take care, the threaded inserts are  difficult to use.
